# arrays-minimal-difference
## Task
This Java 8 tested console app reads input, checks 
difference between 2 arrays elements (ints) and returns 2 elements,
1 from each array, with minimal difference between these elements.

In the first line app receives N, which is 
the length of the first array, in the second line app receives this array,
in the third line app receives M,which is
the length of the second array, in the fourth line app receives this array.

App stops and returns nothing if any restriction broken.

## Restrictions:
- input only 1 int number in the first and third row;
- 1<= N <= 1000_000, 1<= M <= 1000_000;
- input int arrays of corresponding length, each element separated from another with space.

## Example:
### Input
- 5
- -9 -5 0 1 5
- 3
- -8 -3 7

### Output
- -9 -8
