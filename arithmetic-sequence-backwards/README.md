# arithmetic-sequence-backwards
## Task
This Java 8 tested console app reads 3 integers (a, x, n) from input and returns 
backward-oriented arithmetic sequence of n elements with difference of x between adjacent elements,
ending with a (this done if no restrictions has been broken, if broken - returns nothing).

## Restrictions:
- input only 3 natural (exclude 0) numbers in one (first) row;
- numbers should be up to 100_000 for a and n, up to 1000 for x.

## Example:
### Input
- 1 3 5

### Output
- 13 10 7 4 1
